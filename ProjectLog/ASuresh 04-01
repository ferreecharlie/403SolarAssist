This week:
We had a meeting with Dr. Lusher to regroup our thoughts. We reassigned roles and brainstormed on how to tackle this new layout
I researched a little further based on the specifications given by Dr. Lusher

Next week:
I should be able to start building a schematic and simulation circuit to start testing and add modifications to get to a good point to demo 2-3 weeks later.
By the next meeting I will have a better idea of what components to use and recreate on the softwares.
