For the week of February 27th, I have accomplished these tasks:

1) Selected the MSP-432 microcontroller from TI as the one to be used for my subsystem
2) Determined what kinds of sensors and detectors will be needed (power, current, and voltage)
3) Midterm presentation

By the end of next week, i should accomplish these tasks:

1) Order MSP-432 microcontroller
2) Develop general wiring diagram for Subsystem
