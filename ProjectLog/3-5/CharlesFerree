For the week of March 5th, I have accomplished these tasks:

1) Ordered the MSP-432 microcontroller
2) Ordered a voltage/current/power sensor for testing
3) Began development of general wiring diagram

By the end of the week after spring break, I should accomplish these tasks:

1) Flesh out general wiring diagram
2) Begin assembly of microcontroller and its basic structure
3) Determine effectiveness and functionality of sensor
