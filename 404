Microcontroller subsystem team: Continue working on reading sensor data with the msp 432.

Week of 26th October:
DC-DC Converter subsystem team: Converter testing 
Microcontroller subsystem team: Move code over to arduino instead of MSP 432 and test sensors and controls on arduino.

Week of 2nd November:
DC-DC Converter subsystem team: Testing converter; prepare presentation; tested inverter
Microcontroller subsystem team: Finish wiring up sensors to MUX and tested all sensors and controls at the same time.

Week of 9th November:
DC-DC Converter subsystem team: Test converter and integrate into full system; tested solar panels
Microcontroller subsystem team: Test completed code and integrate with new controller for demo
